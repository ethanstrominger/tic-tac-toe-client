# Objectives

# Technologies used
* HTML
* CSS / SASS
* JavaScript
  - jQuery
  - AJAX
  - bootstrap

# Planning
I created a list of tasks, mostly based on what was given in class, and executed one at a time.  I made a schedule to determine which days I would do on what tasks.  As I tested and reviewed the application, I added my own tasks.  I implemented small features and tested and committed as I went along.  I also created a test plan.  At the end of the project, I reviewed the requirements line by line, created a test plan, and manually executed.

# Problem Solving
For problem solving:
* Error messages: Trace down the error.
* Unexpected behavior: Either walk through the code from beginning of code or end of code.  Also, use console.log to see if values are as expected.

# Unsolved problems
Letters are not centered horizontally.  Ui could be more attractive.
